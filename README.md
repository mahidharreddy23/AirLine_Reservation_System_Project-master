 Next, go to the project root folder using cmd or a code editor and run `npm install` command to install basic dependencies. Then run the same command in the client directory and server directory as follows.

```bash
npm install
cd client
npm install
cd ..
cd server
npm install
```
Now, all the dependencies are installed. Then use `npm start` in the client directory to access the frontend and use  `node index.js` to activate backend api.

```bash
cd client
npm start
cd ..
cd server
node index.js
```

The site should be running on <http://localhost:3000/>
